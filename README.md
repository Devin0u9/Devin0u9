# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Devin

I'm a hands-on cybersecurity learner currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam. I’m working through TryHackMe labs and learning Linux administration with plans to earn the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) certification.

This GitHub is where I document my learning, projects, and progress.

## 🔐 Current Focus
- Security+ Certification (in progress)
- TryHackMe Blue Team & Pre-Security
- RHCSA Lab Practice
